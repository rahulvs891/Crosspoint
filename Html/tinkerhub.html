            TinkerHub MEC Chapter is a branch of a non-profit organization that has the aim to learn, interact, and innovate. We provide students with opportunities to enhance their skills through hands-on-experience and community learning culture. </p>

<p> Seeds of TinkerHub were sown in the soil of Model Engineering College in April 2019 by a group of enthusiastic students. The main aim of this initiative is to provide students with learning opportunities for relevant technical skills through peer-to-peer learning. Knowledge is the treasure that increases by sharing. Through enhanced networking opportunities, students can avail the necessary guidance and inspiration from their peers. 
</p>
<p>TinkerHub also provides internships and volunteering for students to develop their leadership and organizational skills. The further steps of the MEC chapter will focus on teaching more skills to more students thus enhancing a bigger learning community.
